# Raspberry Pi Projects
Here is where I will put the code for my Raspberry Pi Projects. Each of these will be laid out in this format...
 
## LED Project [Title]
This project is my first using the Raspberry Pi and GPIO ports. It is very simple: all that it does is turn on an LED at GPIO27 when a person types on(27). This can be adapted to be triggered by buttons and sensors. Similar code also works for other components, like buzzers.
