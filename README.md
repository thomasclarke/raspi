# RASPBERRY PI PROJECTS
Here is where I will put the code and info for my projects using the Raspberry Pi. I will lay out each of these like the demo below...


## <i>Title â€“</i> LED Project
This project is my first using the Raspberry Pi and GPIO ports. It is very simple: all that it does is turn on an LED at GPIO27 when a person types on(27). This can be adapted to be triggered by buttons and sensors. Similar code also works for other components, like buzzers.
